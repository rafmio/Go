ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol
It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and
optional information indicating success or failure when communication with
another IP address.
Messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in
response to errors in IP operations. ICMP errors are directed to the source IP
addresses of the originating packet.
