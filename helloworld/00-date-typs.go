Data Types:
1.Basic type: numbers, strings, booleans
2.Aggregate type: array and structs
3.Reference type: pointers, slices, maps, functions and channels
4.Interface type

Integers: 
- int8, int16, int32, int64
- uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
- int
- uint 
- rune - it is a synonym of int32 and also represent Unicode code points
- byte - is a synonym of uint8 
- uintptr - it is an unsigned integer type. Its width is not defined, but its can hold all the bits of a pointer value

Floating-Point Numbers:
- float32 
- float64 

Complex Numbers: 
- complex64 - contain float32 as real and imaginary component
- complex128 - contain float64 as a real adn imaginary component

Booleans:
- bool 

Strings
The string data type represents a sequence of Unicode code points.
String is a sequence of immutable bytes, means once a string is created you cannot change that string.
