The organization of nodes in a network is called its topology.
Topology types:
  1. point-to-point (simplest)
  2. dasiy chain (series of p2p connections)
  3. bus
  4. ring
  5. star
  6. mesh
  7. hybrid

Daisy chain
Series of p2p connections. Intermediate nodes between an origin node and a
destination node are commonly known as 'hops'.

Bus topology
Common network link. Wired bus network aren't common, but this type of topology
drives wireless networks.

Star topology
Will likely encounter this network topology in wired networks.
Central node - network switch

ISP - internet service provider

Latency - measure of the time that passes between sending a request and

CDN - content delivery network. Географически распределенная сетевая
инфраструктура. Входящие в CDN серверы расположены т.о., чтобы сделать время
