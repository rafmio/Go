IPv4 consists of 2 components:
  - network ID
  - host ID

CIDR - Classes Inter-Domain Routing

The combination of an IP address and a port number is a socket address (address:port)

Ports:
0 to 1023 - well-known ports assigned to common services by the IANA (Internet
            Assigned Numbers Authority)
1024 to 49151 - for lesser common services
49152 to 65535 -  for client sockets

The web server sends its response to the socket address corresponding to the
socket your web browser is monitoring. Your OS receives the response and passes
it onto your web browser through the socket.

NAT - network address translation

Unicast addressing - sending packets from one IP to another IP
Broadcastring - for all
